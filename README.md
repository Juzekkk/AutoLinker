## Title to Link Converter for Obsidian

This Obsidian plugin converts titles to Obsidian-style links in your markdown files. It makes it easier to interlink your notes and enhance the connectivity of your knowledge base.

### Features

- Automatically detects titles from markdown file names.
- Converts occurrences of these titles into Obsidian-style links (`[[Title]]`).
- Case-insensitive linking.
- Ensures titles that are already in link format don't get nested.

### Usage

1. Open the command palette in Obsidian (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).
2. Search for `Convert Titles to Obsidian Links` and run this command.
3. A notice will be displayed once the conversion is complete.
